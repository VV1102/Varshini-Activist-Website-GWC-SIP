  <h4 class = "homeintro">Risk Factors</h4>
    <p class = "homeintro">Even though abuse and neglect occurs in all types of families, children are mostly at risk in certain cases.</p>
    <br>
    <ul class = "cool">
      <li>
        <h5>Domestic Violence</h5>
        <p>No matter howmuch a parent cares for their child.  Using domestic violence is also a form of abuse.The best way to help your child is stop or get help if you are unable to.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Alcohol and Drug Abuse</h5>
        <p>Parents who are drunk or high often make impuslive decisions and that can lead to physical abuse and even saying things they don't mean and scare the child away.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Untreated Mental Illness</h5>
        <p>Parents who are suffering from depression, an anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, or another mental illness may have trouble taking care of themselves, much less their children. A mentally ill or traumatized parent may be distant and withdrawn from their children, or quick to anger without understanding why. Treatment for the caregiver means better care for the children.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Lack of Parenting Skills</h5>
        <p>Some caregivers never learned the skills necessary for good parenting. Teen parents, for example, might have unrealistic expectations about how much care babies and small children need. Or parents who were themselves victims of child abuse may only know how to raise their children the way they were raised. Parenting classes, therapy, and caregiver support groups are great resources for learning better parenting skills.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Stress and Lack of Support</h5>
        <p> Parenting can be a very time-intensive, stressful job, especially if you‚Äôre raising children without support from family and friends, or you‚Äôre dealing with relationship problems or financial difficulties. Caring for a child with a disability, special needs, or difficult behaviors is also a challenge. It‚Äôs important to get the support you need, so you are emotionally and physically able to support your child.</p>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

    
<h4 class = "homeintro">Recognizing Abusive Behavior in Yourself</h4>

<p class = "homeintro">Raising children is a big challenge.  It can cause anger and frustration even in the most calmest parents.  If you grew up in a house of shouting or violence being normal, you may not know another way to raise your kids.  Recognizing that your are the cause of the problem is the largest step to getting support.  These signs may show tou that you are the cause of child abuse and/or neglect.</p>

<ul class = "cool">
<li>
<h5>You can‚Äôt stop your anger.</h5>
<p>What starts as a swat on the backside may turn into multiple hits getting harder and harder. You may shake your child more and more and finally throw them down. You find yourself screaming louder and louder and can‚Äôt stop yourself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h5>You feel emotionally disconnected from your child.</h5>
<p>You may feel so overwhelmed that you don‚Äôt want anything to do with your child. You just want to be left alone and for your child to be quiet.</p>
</li>


<li>
<h5>Meeting the daily needs of your child seems impossible.</h5> 

<p>While everyone struggles with balancing dressing, feeding, and getting kids to school or other activities, if you continually can‚Äôt manage to do it, it‚Äôs a sign that something might be wrong.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h5>Other people have expressed concern.</h5> 
<p>It may be easy to bristle at other people expressing concern. However, consider carefully what they have to say. Are the words coming from someone you normally respect and trust?</p>
</li>

<br>
    
<h4 class = "homeintro">Breaking the Cycle of Abuse</h4>

<ul class = "cool">
  <li>
    <h5>Learn what is age appropriate and what is not. </h5>
    <p>Realistic expectations of what children at different ages want can help you avoid frustration and anger at typical child behavior.  </p>
  </li>
     
  
  <li>
   <h5>Develop new parenting skills. </h5>
    <p>Start by learning appropriate discipline techniques and how to set clear boundaries for your children. Parenting classes, books, and seminars offer this information. You can also turn to other parents for tips and advice.</p> 
  </li>

  
  <li>
    <h5>Take care of yourself. </h5>
    <p>If you are not getting enough rest and support or you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, you are much more likely to succumb to anger. Sleep deprivation, common in parents of young children, adds to moodiness and irritability‚Äîexactly what you are trying to avoid.</p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <h5>Learn to control your emotions. </h5>
    <p>If you were abused or neglected as a child, you may have hard time controlling your emotions. You may have had to deny or suppress them as a child, and now they come out without your knowledge.</p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <h5>Get professional help.  </h5>
    <p>If you can‚Äôt seem to stop yourself no matter how hard you try, it‚Äôs time to get help, whether in the form of therapy, parenting classes, or other interventions.</p>
