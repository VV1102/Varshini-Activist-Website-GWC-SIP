  <h4 class = "homeintro">Benefits of Foster Care</h4>
    <p class = "homeintro">Foster Care: The care of the guardian that the orphanage or foster home places an orphan or foster child with.</p>
    <ol class = "cool">
      <li>
        <h5>One on One Attention</h5>
        <p>Due to their large numbers and responsibilities, orphanages donâ€™t provide children with complete support. Even the best caregivers canâ€™t give orphans equal attention.

Luckily, foster parents donâ€™t face this issue. They manage to spend quality time with the children under their care. It leads to more bonding time with the little ones. These children also learn how to foster healthy relationships with a parent figure.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Better Opportunities </h5>
        <p>In terms of education, foster children are often ahead of orphans from other systems. They get to attend reputable schools and participate in extracurricular activities. These benefits of foster care give them the scope to indulge in their passions and ambitions.

This, in turn, boosts the childâ€™s confidence and self-esteem.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5> Cultivates Family Values</h5>
        <p>It doesnâ€™t matter if an orphan comes from broken homes, abusive homes, neglect, or a string of orphanages. The chances are that these children have no clue what a family means.

Living with a foster family (that might have other kids too) gives them a new life. They finally get to experience the love, compassion, and connectivity they might not have experienced before.</p>
      </li>

    <h4 class = "homeintro">What Facilities to Orphanages and Foster Homes Generally Have?</h4>

    <p class = "homeintro">Not all orphanages or foster homes are as bad
    as the ones in the movies or Oliver Twist.  Although their quality varies, below are often some of the facilities offered at these homes.</p>

    <br>
    <ul class = "cool">
      <li>Proper Clothing</li>
      <li>Periodic Meals</li>
      <li>Access to Education</li>
      <li>Room and Boarding</li>
      <li>Care from Wardens</li>
      <li>Orphanage Officials Looking for Suitable Guardians</li>
    </ul>

  <p class = "homeintro">Sending a child who is facing abuse or neglect to they point where their appearance is deteriorating and/or social behaviors are not developing correctly to a foster home may be the best option for both the child and their parent or guardian.  Some homes can give a child what they need.  Although they may find themselves missing the adult that used to be in charge of them, this separation will be better for them in the long run.  It is important to send these kids to a home with good quality facilities.  <a href = "fosterhomes.html">Click here</a> for some wonderful options.</p>
